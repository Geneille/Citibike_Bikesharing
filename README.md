# Citibike_Bikesharing

## Overview

Bike sharing have been a growing means of commute for many people in and around major cities. Bike sharing not only offer a quick and easy means of transport for users, but its popularity has been growing owing to its positive impact on the environment and its potential profit for investors. The main aim of this report was to analyze a set of data and create visualizations in an effort to convince potential investors that a bike-sharing program can be feasible for the city of Des Moines. 

## Analysis

In general, the analyis consisted of two main parts: 

* using Pandas to change the necessary datatype to the correct format/datatype for analysis, and
* create a set of visualizations in Tableau public

## Results

Figure 1a below shows basic consumer metric information. Annual subscribers and males dominate the market share/usage of citibikes. In addition, usage of citibikes is independent of age as displayed in Figure 1b.

Figure 2 illustraes the peak riding hours and top starting locations. As can be observed, peak hours of citibikes usage occurs between 4 and 7 pm and to a lesser extent 7 to 9 am. Top starting location occurs in midtown Manhattan.

As can be observed in Figure 3 below citibikes usage on average is dominated for 4 to 6 hours. In other words, the largest amount of checkout bikes is between 4 to 6 hours.

Figure 4 below illustrates the number of bikes checked out is largest among males between 4 to 6 hours.

The heat map displayed in Figure 5 shows that trips are dominant during the weekdays (monday to friday) between the hours of 6 and 9 am and 4 and 7 pm. In addition, male subscribers dominate the use of citibikes.

Figure 6 shown below further highlights male dominance in citibikes usage during peak hours. Female usage of citibikes occurs mainly between 5 and 6 pm during the weekdays, with a decrease in activity on wednesdays. For both genders, there is an increase in activity on a saturday between 10 am and 7 pm, although the usage is still not as high as during the weekdays peak hours.

## Summary

The main insights that can be drawn from the analysis are:

1. Annual subscribers and males dominate the use/market share of citi bikes.
2. Peak riding hours is between 4pm and 7pm coinciding with top starting locations being midtown Manhattan. In addition, between 7am and 9am citibikes usage is also high.
3. Citibikes usage is dominant during the weekdays (monday to friday) during the above mentioned times, but there appears to be an increase in use over more hours on a saturday (from 10am to 7pm)
4. Highest bike checkouts usually last 4 to 6 hours.

From these insights the following recommendations can be made:

1. Promotions can be done to increase daily customers (non-subscribers/tourist) use of citibikes.
2. Promotions can be done to increase the use of citibikes among females, with the ultimate goal of acquiring more female subscribers.
3. Data suggest citibikes are being used as a means of commute for the working professionals, thus it must be ensured bikes are always available during these peak hours.

Two more analysis that can be done to draw more insights include:

* investigating the relationship between gender and starting/end locations. This will help to identify if for example the lack of use among females is due to bikes availabilty or lack thereof in any particular location.
* investigating the relationship between trip duration and starting and ending locations. This will help identify if the potential exist to increase citibikes availabilty in any area.
